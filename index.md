## The Blog

Salutations! We are Three of Four, originally known as Group Four. In the following space resides our blog, in which we discuss a variety of topics from an ethical point-of-view.

The recent string of female voices that shed light on the misogynistic cultures at the GitHub and Uber workplaces reveal that these unwelcoming environments often stem from the corrupting influence of founders and executive officers, specifically through their gravely egregious actions and enabling negligence. A rather uncomfortable narrative was detailed by Julie Ann Hovarth in her interview with TechCrunch, to whom she described several tense interactions with one of the co-founders of GitHub and his wife. [1] Furthermore, Hovarth alleged that throughout her last few months at GitHub, she was bullied into leaving and faced constant harassment—particularly from the co-founder’s wife. Hovarth dutifully reported the misconduct to human resources, but found that the department was either unwilling or unable to help her. A similar pattern has been said about the environment at Uber, in which the harassment from “high performing” employees were chiefly protected by the former-CEO Travis Kalanick. The culture is rooted in the highest levels of management. If these figures are tolerant of sexism and harassment, it can be difficult to hold them—and other misbehaving employees—accountable for their actions.

Employees often look to management to gauge what behavior is acceptable, so its systemic neglect can naturally court a substantial number of unaffected male employees to allow such a toxic work environment to fester. The invariable exoneration of these “high performing” individuals paves the way for their continued ascension up the corporate ladder—thereby cultivating more influence in the company and its culture whilst deteriorating it as well. [2] [3] Our group believes that bystander employees acting under a duty-based framework have an ethical responsibility to report misconduct and harassment to human resources, although we also realize that under a consequentialist framework there may be hesitation from a lack of individual impact. From the perspective of the victims, such efforts surely will be appreciated but may ultimately make little or no difference.

Additionally, our group suggests that making these incidents public can put a lot of pressure on shareholders, forcing them to keep company leadership accountable to their actions, as was the case with the resignation of Travis Kalanick. [4] As more female employees come forward with credible accusations of sexism in the workplace, they raise a great deal of awareness for the issue in the tech industry. Companies may be more perceptive of the issue and make attempts to prevent sexism in the workplace in the future. Ideally, this will lead to more company-wide discussions about the issue and a change in employee attitude. On the other hand, fewer women may pursue a job at a technology company because of these incidents. Women currently in tech may feel more isolated and the toxic behavior toward female employees may increase.

The actions undertaken by all three group members in this scenario are understandable and—to a certain extent—ethically justified. Once confronted with Alice’s code, which he didn’t comprehend, Bob may have paired his academic obligations with a duty-based ethical framework to avoid being recognized as a free-rider. He may have felt uncomfortable submitting code he didn’t understand under his name. However, his actions put Carlos in a challenging position, where he has to decide whether to side with Bob or Alice’s code. Moreover, Alice may sense that her work is being undervalued. As such, this association may indirectly affect Carlos’ behavior in the context of their relationship and the larger group. Our group believes that under ideal circumstances, these dynamics shouldn’t be affected by gender. Contrastingly in reality, they easily could. If Alice was male, Carlos may be more inclined to side with Bob. Likewise, if Carlos was female, Bob may feel singled out by Carlos and Alice.

This incident negatively affects the dynamics among the team members. The group became significantly more unproductive when Bob began rewriting already completed code, especially under the possibility of him working on a separate aspect of the project. The individuals may be less inclined to work with each other in the future because of their miscommunication. Even in the event that Bob’s code is of better quality than Alice’s, the group has a dilemma between submitting better quality code and submitting code more representative of the group’s work as a whole. While we believe the group can come to a peaceful resolution, there is considerable potential for lingering resentment.

Our group suggests that Bob should use his own code to understand Alice’s code. In this way, Bob’s code would serve a purpose even if it isn’t ultimately turned in, and he works to redeem his relationship with his team members. Carlos should help Bob learn Alice’s code by evaluating Bob’s code. This would be fair to both parties, because Bob would then be a better student by learning two different methods of writing code that accomplishes the same task, and Alice would not feel as if her hard work is going to waste. Additionally Alice should teach Bob her thought process when she wrote her code in a way that Bob can understand. Alice’s code should be submitted to the master version of the project, because Carlos and herself both understand her code. Bob overstepped his bounds by not communicating his lack of understanding in an effective way, so he must compromise more than Carlos and Alice must.

The delimitation between sexual acts under consent and those not is situationally dependent enough that a strict, broad brush wouldn’t properly take into consideration the complex array of implicit factors that affect the dynamics of an act. Recently, the #MeToo movement has brought in a wave of heightened attention to this issue, so it is seems more essential than ever for hard-and-fast sexual consent laws to be established. However, it is inherently difficult to ensure sexual consent is given, as conflicting words and actions can be perceived inconsistently by different people in the diverse modern society. Our group believes that only explicit consent (i.e. the question is asked, and an enthusiastic verbal affirmation is given) should count as consent, contrary to RAINN’s assertion that positive physical cues are enough. [1] This definition still runs into issues of power imbalances, as when someone tries to resist sexual advances from their boss and is pressured into saying “yes” out of fear of repercussions in his or her career. [2]

These convolutions of sexual consent can be further complicated with the introduction of third-party bystanders. Take, for example, a situation in which a bystander witnesses a man making sexual advances on an intoxicated woman. Using a duty-based ethical framework, the bystander has a responsibility to stop the situation, either by drawing public attention to the offense or talking to the woman or man in question. However, even this can be difficult depending on the situation, e.g. the person making unwanted advances is a friend of the bystander, or there are no other people around to support the bystander’s actions. Another ethically questionable situation can occur when someone gives a hesitant “yes” in response to sexual advances. In the same duty-based framework, a person making sexual advances has an ethical responsibility to ensure that the encounter is enjoyable for all parties involved, even if they’ve received verbal consent and are protected from legal repercussions. [3]

Our group believes that technology has helped this conversation by increasing awareness of these issues due to feminist groups on social media and the #MeToo movement. [4] Bringing attention to the problem is the first step in finding a solution to the problem. However, other solutions that technology has offered, including smartphone app-based consent, are incomplete or unhelpful. The biggest problem with apps such as blockchain-based LegalFling and SMS-based Good2Go is that they do not account for withdrawal of consent. [5] [6] In maintaining the consistency of applications of deontology, these apps are appreciated as potential solutions to the issue of binding legality. However, our group believes that they are unwieldy and consequently too inconvenient to fully address the complexities of sexual consent.
