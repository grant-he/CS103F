The delimitation between sexual acts under consent and those not is situationally dependent enough that a strict, broad brush wouldn’t properly take into consideration the complex array of implicit factors that affect the dynamics of an act. Recently, the #MeToo movement has brought in a wave of heightened attention to this issue, so it is seems more essential than ever for hard-and-fast sexual consent laws to be established. However, it is inherently difficult to ensure sexual consent is given, as conflicting words and actions can be perceived inconsistently by different people in the diverse modern society. Our group believes that only explicit consent (i.e. the question is asked, and an enthusiastic verbal affirmation is given) should count as consent, contrary to RAINN’s assertion that positive physical cues are enough. [1] This definition still runs into issues of power imbalances, as when someone tries to resist sexual advances from their boss and is pressured into saying “yes” out of fear of repercussions in his or her career. [2]

These convolutions of sexual consent can be further complicated with the introduction of third-party bystanders. Take, for example, a situation in which a bystander witnesses a man making sexual advances on an intoxicated woman. Using a duty-based ethical framework, the bystander has a responsibility to stop the situation, either by drawing public attention to the offense or talking to the woman or man in question. However, even this can be difficult depending on the situation, e.g. the person making unwanted advances is a friend of the bystander, or there are no other people around to support the bystander’s actions. Another ethically questionable situation can occur when someone gives a hesitant “yes” in response to sexual advances. In the same duty-based framework, a person making sexual advances has an ethical responsibility to ensure that the encounter is enjoyable for all parties involved, even if they’ve received verbal consent and are protected from legal repercussions. [3]

Our group believes that technology has helped this conversation by increasing awareness of these issues due to feminist groups on social media and the #MeToo movement. [4] Bringing attention to the problem is the first step in finding a solution to the problem. However, other solutions that technology has offered, including smartphone app-based consent, are incomplete or unhelpful. The biggest problem with apps such as blockchain-based LegalFling and SMS-based Good2Go is that they do not account for withdrawal of consent. [5] [6] In maintaining the consistency of applications of deontology, these apps are appreciated as potential solutions to the issue of binding legality. However, our group believes that they are unwieldy and consequently too inconvenient to fully address the complexities of sexual consent.
